# installify-example

A small programmatic demo of [installify](https://github.com/hughsk/installify#readme), a browserify transform for the lazy JavaScripter. installify automatically installs missing dependencies when bundling for quick and dirty prototyping.

## Running the Example

Node >=4 is required for this to work, because it uses ES2015 stuff.

```sh
npm test
```

The output is the result of piping [./lazy.js](lazy.js) through `installify` and `babelify`.

The [alphabet](http://npm.im/alphabet) dependency is installed automatically, and even added to package.json.

## Dependencies

- [alphabet](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/alphabet): The english alphabet as a string or array, upper and lowercase.
- [babel-preset-es2015](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages): Babel preset for all es2015 plugins.
- [babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify): Babel browserify transform
- [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify): browser-side require() the node way
- [concat-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/concat-stream): writable stream that concatenates strings or binary data and calls a callback with the result
- [installify](https://github.com/hughsk/installify): A browserify transform that automatically installs missing dependencies
